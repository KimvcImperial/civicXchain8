# 🌍 CivicXChain - Sepolia Testnet Setup

## ✅ What's Been Cleaned Up

All Hardhat/localhost references have been removed. The project now runs exclusively on Sepolia testnet.

### 🗑️ Removed:
- Local blockchain (`npx hardhat node`)
- Localhost contract addresses
- Hardhat network configurations
- Local deployment scripts

### 🔧 Updated:
- All contract addresses point to Sepolia
- Network configurations use Sepolia RPC
- Package.json scripts simplified
- Start script updated

## 🚀 How to Run (Simplified)

### 1. Start the Platform
```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts:
- ✅ Backend API (port 8000)
- ✅ Frontend (port 3000)
- ❌ No blockchain node needed!

### 2. Connect MetaMask
- Network: **Sepolia Testnet**
- Chain ID: **11155111**
- RPC: **https://eth-sepolia.public.blastapi.io**

### 3. Get Sepolia ETH
- Visit: https://sepoliafaucet.com/
- Or: https://faucet.sepolia.dev/

## 📋 Contract Addresses (Sepolia)

```javascript
GOVERNANCE_CONTRACT: '0xE16F89910DF3Bd0f1C06b667F85D2b68582BA4c4'
ENVIRONMENTAL_ORACLE: '0x660d07eE351eBB4BF55CFD9327c128459a7c2fBD'
```

## 🔍 Why Commitments Weren't Showing

The issue was **ABI mismatch** between:
- `CIVIC_CONTRACT_ABI` (incomplete)
- `CIVIC_GOVERNANCE_ABI` (complete)

**Fixed**: All components now use `CIVIC_GOVERNANCE_ABI` consistently.

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Restart your application**: `npm run dev`
2. **Clear browser cache** (important!)
3. **Reconnect MetaMask** to Sepolia
4. **Try creating a commitment**

These commitments should now persist after computer restarts since they're stored on the permanent Sepolia blockchain!
